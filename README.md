## **Antlysis Design Create React App Template for members**

Purpose of this create react template is to have a standardized code being used for every member in Antlysis Design Sdn Bhd to prevent the process to rebuild and bugs possibility on some of the reused features.

### To generate react app with this template

`npx create-react-app app-name --template cra-template-antemplate`

In this template I've already prepared the test script for all the pre-built in components like

1. Form components

Just do `npm test` to test all your component if you have changed the file codes to make sure the intended functionality were not accidentally removed.

If there is any features that needs to be added or enhanced, please let me know.
